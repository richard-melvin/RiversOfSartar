## 1.1 Why Rivers of Sartar?

Runequest:Glorantha provides detailed rules for effectively simulating the world of Glorantha. These help in understanding how that unfamiliar world works, but are often ignored in actual play by experienced GMs

Questworlds provides fast-handling storytelling rules that are capable of handling any genre, providing you already understand that genre.

Rivers of Sartar attenpts to blend these two approaches to provide the best of both worlds, in a way reminiscent of modern Chaosium BRP games such as Rivers of London.

It is always *fast-handling*, in that it requires almost no arithmetic, table lookup or repetitive dice rolling during play.

It starts from a baseline of storytelling, in a way that also allows elements of world-simulation and simple tactical gameplay to be added as desired.
