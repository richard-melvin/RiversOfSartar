As covered in previous blog posts, the RQ:G rules define a fairly complex system of cults, subcults and associate cults. 
The Cults of Runequest series makes heavy use of that rules framework to describe the cults it covers. 
The next volume, coming soon, will cover Solar cults, filling perhaps the biggest remaining gap for playing in the Dragon Pass area.

So I thought I would bring forward publish this part of the series, before that book comes out and contradicts everything in it.

# What is a Doctrine?

The dictionary definition of `doctrine` is, in Gloranthan terms, a belief or set of beliefs held and taught by a cult or subcult. A doctrine covers the information a player would know, if they made a successful Cult Lore roll, or what a senior Priest would answer, if asked a hypothetical question. 

If the RQ:G rules _are_ the underlying truth of the setting, a doctrine is a group's _understanding_ of the truth. The RQ:G rules say that Barntar is a subcult of Orlanth; different groups of Barntar cultists may or may not agree. It is useful to keep the distinction in mind; what a group believes may or may not be true. But they still believe it, and will act on it.

Sometimes a cult has a uniform doctrine across all temples and organisation; probably more commonly different groupings have somewhat different doctrines.

Widespread and longstanding doctrines are typically, mostly true, at least in so far as they cover things within common experience. A doctrine becomes unsustainable if it too directly contradicts people's personal religious experience. A doctrine can say the Red Moon _should_ not exist; it will be in trouble if it says it _does_ not exist. 

Note that the beliefs of a community become manifest in the spirit of that community, the wyter. So if that wyter is locally responsible for sending spirits of retribution, or answering divinations, that doctrine will be the thing it is basing its decisions on. So a doctrine needs to be demonstrably wrong in some significant way to be rejected.

# The Monrogh Doctrine

The best known example of a doctrine is the one created by a Sartarite hero of Yelmalio, Monrogh. This transformed the beliefs of the Yelmalio worshippers of the Dragon Pass region, leading to a different set of subcults being present. At least as the doctrine has it, Monrogh did not change anything, merely discovered things that had always been true. The claim is that the new doctrine was demonstrably less wrong than prior beliefs, and so came to largely supplant them.

The Monrogh Doctrine reconciles the many ways of worshipping Yelmalio by claiming they are all valid, but represent Yelmalio as he was at different stages of his divone life. And as the Other Side is timeless, it is possible to meet and talk to any of those successive versions of him. Each of these versions represent the different subcults of Yelmalio.


The diagram above summarises this. In it, Yelmalio is a sun of Yelm, sibling to Vrimak, and associated with the celestial body Lightfore. The horse nomads of Pent worship the him as Kargzant, though they get pretty much everything else about him wrong.  

As a young man, Yelmalio was brought up in the Imperial Palace. The Dara Happans know this version of him as Antirius. In the palace, he was a close companion of Yelm's son Avivorius, who wielded the Sun Spear. As a result, Antirius cultists can cast that spell reusably, while those Yelmalians who worship later versions must seek permission from Yelm for each casting.

Leaving the palace, he travelled widely, meeting Aldrya of the elves, who call him Halamalao. When he came to the Hill of Gold, he met, fought and then befriended Orlanth. The Elmali say that is the end of the story, he settled down, married Redaylda, and serves Orlanth still.

What they did not know is that, when Orlanth left on the Lightbringers Quest, Ernalda spoke to him. On her advice, he left Orlanth's stead in hands of other defenders, and returned to the Hill of Gold, aiming to bring light to all those holding out until the Dawn. There was a demon of Darkness who did not want that to be, and fought him. The Hellacali of Vanch think he fights there still, and hope that one day he will win.

But we know that he did not prevail, but instead endured, climbing further up the Hill. They he met a demon of Cold; the Khelmali of Imther think he is still locked in her embrace. But we know he endured, and made it to the top of that Hill. From there, his light spread to all mountains, and so kept world alive for long enough for Orlanth to save it.

Come the dawn, as she had promised, Ernalda accepted him amongst her husbands. Since then, there have been a number of mortal heros, in different lands, who discovered new truths about Yelmalio's story. Monrogh is merely the latest.


# What could the Doctrine be wrong about?

Plausibly, the relation of Yelmalio and Antirius. Antirius is a minor cult in a distant land, with a lot of the same associates. It is much less likely to be wrong about Elmal, as many thousands of Sartarites in Monrogh's time had the experience of worshipping both.

Related to that, the detail that Yelmalio was born from the dismemberment of Yelm  need not be so; nothing much would change if he was instead the son of Yelm and some other Goddess such as Dendara. 

The Bridling of Kargzant may represent a significant change to the Other Side after 0 ST. Which is the one thing all Lightbringers agree is either impossible, or only pissible by breaking the iniverse in a chaotic way.
  
# What happens if your Glorantha varies?

If for reasons of plot or just taste, there is something about the rules or cults book you want to change, then do so. That change then becomes the new underlying truth for doctrines to be wrong about.

It is just that if you want plausibility, be careful about the way in which beliefs can differ from truth. 


# Yelmalio, Defender of the Stead

A common name for this aspect of Yelmalio is Elmal. Followers rarely correct those who use that name, though they know it is wrong; Yelmalio is the Son of the Son, not the Sun itself.

Following the death of Yelm, his son Yelmalio wandered far and wide from the Imperial Palace where he was born. During that wandering he made many friends and allies, who taught him many tricks of fighting, protection and survival.

On those travels, he met Orlanth, the Storm King. In the way of such stories, Initially they fought, but later joined forces to drive off hostile demons of Darkness and Cold. Yelmalio pledged etarnal friendship and loyalty. 

When Orlanth went to resurrect the Sun, Yelmalio was appointed to guard Orlamth's stead.
Subcult members know that Yelmalio later broke his pledge, seducing Ernalda and claiming rule in his own right. They solemnly vow to never do the same.

Temples

The sole temple following this subcult is the Yelmalio temple in Runegate, in Colymar lands. This is a tribally-sponsored temple that trains patrollers for all Colymar clans, and scouts for the Colymar warband.

Many Yelmalio shrines in Orlanthi in Sartar and neighbouring lands could be considered to follow this subcult. Though with a shrine, or site, it is hard to make a firm distinction between one subcult and another.

Ranks

Lay, initiate and godtalker as standard. There are no full priests who formally follow this subcult, though two of the priests at the Ruengate temple are sympathetic to it.

The subcult also supports Rune Lords, known as Sun Lords, who serve as clan champions or in the retinue of tribal kings.

Relation to Other Subcults

The subcult accepts that Yelmalio of the Sun Dome is the true expression of what Yelmalio actually did before Time. They simply hold that what he did represents a moral failure, and one they aspire not to fall to.
