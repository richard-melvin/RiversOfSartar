Yelmalio, Defender of the Stead

A common name for this aspect of Yelmalio is Elmal. Followers rarely correct those who use that name, though they know it is wrong; Yelmalio is the Son of the Son, not the Sun itself.

Following the death of Yelm, his son Yelmalio wandered far and wide from the Imperial Palace where he was born. During that wandering he made many friends and allies, who taught him many tricks of fighting, protection and survival.

On those travels, he met Orlanth, the Storm King. In the way of such stories, Initially they fought, but later joined forces to drive off hostile demons of Darkness and Cold. Yelmalio pledged etarnal friendship and loyalty. 

When Orlanth went to resurrect the Sun, Yelmalkio was appointed to guard Orlamth's stead.
Subcult members know that Yelmalio later broke his pledge, seducing Ernalda and claiming rule in his own right. They solemnly vow to never do the same.

Temples

The sole temple following this subcult is the Yelmalio temple in Runegate, in Colymar lands. This is a tribally-sponsored temple that trains patrollers for all Colymar clans, and scouts for the Colymar warband.

Most Yelmalio clan shrines in Sartar and neighbouring lands could be considered to follow this subcult. Though with a shrine, or site, it is hard to make a firm distinction between one subcult and another..

Ranks

Lay, initiate and godtalker as standard. There are no full priests who formally follow this subcult, though two of the priests at the Ruengate temple are sympathetic to it.

The subcult also supports Rune Lords, known as Sun Lords, who serve as clan champions or in the retinue of tribal kings.

Relation to Other Subcults

The subcult accepts that Yelmalio of the Sun Dome is the true expression of what Yelmalio actually did before Time. They simply hold that what he did represents a moral failure, and one they aspire not to fall to.
