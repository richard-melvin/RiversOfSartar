## Magic

Magic permeates Glorantha. It exists in a spectrum between well-understood human magic, as covered by the RQ:G rules, up to natural phenonema such as the tides or sunset. This includes everything in between. Understanding how  Gloranthan magic works, what it can and can't do, and how it can be used in play is one of the key challenges a Runequest GM faces. This is especially true when covering magic outside the specific scope of the game mechanics, but still at least partially within human understanding and control. The game rules contain many references to such magic, using the term *heroquesting*. Such magic is stated at various places in the rules as gaining you a bonus to your harvest roll, as a way to get an exotic mount such as a hippogriff. Gloranthan lore contains references to heroquests that can resurrect the long dead, introduce new magic, transform the understanding of a cult, and even change Glorantha at a cosmic level by raising a new planet or moon.

The RQ2 rules, published 1978, said:

>> The universe is divided into two phases, the spirit plane and the physical plane. [Magical Energy] is to the physical plane what matter is to the physical world. POW is the capacity to collact [that energy].


Herophonmes Statement of Magic, presented in the RQ:G Red Book of Magic, is a in-world document presented as a synthesis of the humanist and theistic world views.  It defines magic as:


>> the interaction of the Mortal and Gods Worlds, and/or of conscious beings against destiny. Although the two polarities are mutually exclusive, there exists a common 
>> ground between them which is the place of energy exchanges. This exchange from mortal to divine or from divine to mortal is known as magic.

Sorcerors, theists and animists have somewhat different concepts of the divine; abstract runes that can be studied, personified gods that can be appeased and emulated, or spirits that can be bargained with and dominated. But they share the idea that magic is what happens when mortals visit and interact with the Other Side.

This post describes how to use that spectrum of magic in play, from a regular weekly worship ceremony to the activites of a world-changing hero like Argrath. 

- *Spells* are the expenditure of magical energy to achieve a known effect on the world. They are covered in the RQ:G rulebook from p243..

- *Divine Intervention* is the unstructured expenditure of magical energy to achieve an unpredictable effect. It is covered in the RQ:G rulebook, p272.

- *Worship* is the sacrifice of personal magical energy to the Other Side. It is covered in the RQ:G rulebook, p315.

- *Rituals* are spells that take substantial time to cast. They are covered in RBoM p7 and RQ:G p245.

- *Ordeals* are magical rituals that test a candidate to see if they pass. In the form of initiation tests, they are mentioned in RQ:G p274. The ordeal required to become a shaman is covered in RQ:G p354.

- *Contests* are magical rituals in which several candidates compete to determine a winner. 

- *Expeditions* are large-scale magical rituals in which a substantial portion of the resources of a clan, tribe, nation or even empire are dedicated to achieving some otherwise-impossible goal. 

- *Conflicts* are magical rituals in which the resources of one or more groups are deployed to opposing ends. 

Any of these can be considered a heroquest; the question of where exactly the boundary is between things that are, and are not, is not especially important.

There are currently no explicit rules for organising or participating in Contests, Expeditions or Conflicts. However:

- Six Seasons in Sartar shows how to run an initiation ordeal in play.

- the Garhound Contest in Sun County, and Pegasus Plateau in the corresponding scenario book, are examples of published adventures based on magical contests.

- Black Spear, in the Jonstown Compendium, is based on an expedition organised by a Sartarite clan. 

- The Chaosium-published solo scenario The Battle of Dangerford, from the starter set, puts the player in the midst of a magical and physical conflict. 

This post provides some guidelines for how to write such scenarios so that they can be run using the regular RQ:G rules. Seperately, in the abscence of official rules, it provides some optional additional rules that may help.

## Heroquesting

A heroquest is defined in RQ:G as 'ritual adventure'. They are described as being able to bring the dead back to life, bring a wyter to a community, grant it additional powers, compel an enemy to attack, acquire a flying mount such as a hippogriff, or provide a bonus to a harvest roll. 
Heroquest rituals are performed during the Sacred Time ceremonies of main Gloranthan religions.

RQ:G Mythology lists Harmast's heroquests:

1. his initiation into the cult of Orlanth, in which he visited Orlanth's hall.

2. every High Holy day of Orlanth, sometimes with the same events visited several times

3. after his death in battle, when he returned to life

4. his Second Initiation, when he became a Rune Priest

5. visits to the Nennorian Tower, Hill of Gold and Lord Aranvark's cabin.

6. when attacked by his enemy Palangio the Iron Vrok

7. his lightbringer's Quest on which he returned with Arkat, visiting Hrela Armali, the Gates of the West, Court of Silence, the Underworld and the Dead Gods court

In the terms defined above, these seem to be:

1 + 4. ordeals

2. worship ceremonies, travelling to Orlanth's Hall and its environs

3. Divine intervention

5. Ritual quests, travelling far across the Other World to areas only known in rumour

7. an expedition across Glorantha, physically travelling through Luatha to the underworld.

This list emphasises the heroquests are very much something that start within the normal scale of RQ adventures, gradually progressing from individual to world-changign scope.
