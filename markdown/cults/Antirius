## Antirius, Keeper of Justice

### Name

While generally agreed to be an aspect of Yelmalio, within historical Dara Happa Antirius is always referred to by his traditional name. 

Antirius is Yelm's justice. This persisted after Yelm's disintegration; how else could the murderer's actions be judged as wrong? 

Antirius ruled in Yelm's place as steward for many years, but justice alone was not enough to preserve perfection. He took successive wounds that 
weakened him, ultimately leading to his death at the Hill of Gold.

He was reborn with Yelm, and some of his former loyalists welcomed his return. Historically, the cult was rather more widespread and important, 
forming a key part of the mechanism of rule of First and Second Age Solar empires.
In the lunar era, outside historical Rinliddi, this role has been almost entirely taken over by Irripi Ontor scribes. As a result, across most areas of Yelm worship, 
it exists only as a subservient cult of Yelm, with shrines run by that cult, instead of independent temples serving their own initiated congregation. 

Instead, when a dispute occurs between Lunar nobles, if both parties agree, an Antirian may be called in to investigate and adjudicate. They also 
judge athletic and other contests, contract disputes between merchants trading between provinces, and so on. 

The cult has a reputation for diligence and trustworthiness that supports that; few will dispute a judgement they agreed should happen. 

### Temples

There is a major urban temple in the small town of Kesium, in the Heartlands Satrapy of First Blessed. This is responsible for training judges across the Empire.
Other full temples are rare, though shrines abound.

### Ranks

Initiates, or their families, must pay a considerable sum to the temple for an apprenticeship. Alternatively, they may win a coveted Imperial scholarship by examination. 

Godtalkers and Priests are referred to as Justices of the Empire. 

Initiates must take on the Yelmalio geas of 'never wear any armour'. They gain the gift of +10% to any cult skill.. 

Judges must take on the Yelmalio geas of 'always speak truth to everyone', and gain the gift of protection from fire. 

There are no rune lords.

### Relation to Related Cults

The cult understands that during the crisis of the Gods War, Antirius took up arms, travelled far and made many allies, and went by many names.
And, under the circumstances, such things were necessary.
However, Yelm is once again alive, and the Emperor is securely on his throne. So the appropriate role of Antirius is to help out his father in the business of rule.

Notes

Given their key role in the wars against Sheng Seleris, there are considerable number of Yelmalian warriors in regiments originally raised the provinces, 
and now stationed in the Heartlands. These Yelmalians are distinct in training and culture from Antirians, but may worship at each other's temples, should they feel the need. 

It has been said that the random nature of Yelmalian gifts and taboos is a consequence of the cults' convoluted mythical history. Antirian gifts and geases are much more predictable.

The retinue of an Antirian judge typically includes bodyguards, researchers and undercover agents. These serve to determine the right set of potential facts for the Judge to magically confirm.

Enforcing a judgement by Sunspear is a common implicit threat, but rare practice.
