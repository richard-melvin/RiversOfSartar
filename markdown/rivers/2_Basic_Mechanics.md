# 2.0 Core Mechanics

In a *Rivers of Sartar* game, stories develop dynamically as you and your GM work together to role-play the dramatic conflict between your group's PCs in pursuit of their 
goals and the challenges,or threats that your GM presents to stand in your way. 

## When to Roll


Some reasons for using randomness in game mechanics include:

1. characterisation: a party must travel for a day on horseback over open terrain. Perhaps characters who fail a ride test simply have an uncomfortable day. They get a 
  chance to express their discomfort, and perhaps wish they were somewhere else.

1. character selection:  a clue could be discovered by any of several characters. It is likely, but not guaranteed, that the one who does so is the one who has the highest rating in a relevant ability. 
   Either case provides an opportunity for characterisation, and possibly, if the players goals are not completely aligned, further plot development.

1. plot branching: a clue might be missed, perhaps placing the party in a dangerous situation they would have preferred to avoid, or requiring them to take a different approach.

1. attrition of resources: performing badly in an encounter might deplete limitied supplies of food or healing magic.

1. risk of death: having the risk of death be present in some, but not all, situations creates a useful distinction between danger and safety.

1. tactical challenge: a game that involves interesting mechanical decisions can be fun in its own right.

If none of these reasons apply, it is likely the situation can be resolved without explicit mechanics or randomness. The PCs simply describe what they do, and the GM narrates what happens next, 
somehwat in the 'Yes, and' style of improvisational comedy, or the *montage* concept from 13th Age.

Alternatively, multiple of these reasons can be combined in a single situation, such as when it is possible any of several characters might discover a clue, but it is also possible noone will.

Support for the first 3 reasons is provided by section 2, *Freeform Gameplay*. The next two are covered by section 4, *Conflict Resolution*. The last is covered by section 5, *Tactical Gameplay*. 
These chapters are designed to be modular, in that each can be used, ignored or replaced. 

> [!NOTE]  
> So you might use just the Freeform Gameplay rules, drop Conflict Resolution, and fall back to the full RQ:G rules for combat.

## How to roll

All rolls are opposed rolls, between *contestants*, each of which is using an *ability*. Each contestant simultaneously rolls a single D100 (the *success D100*), and zero or more D20s (the *bonus D20*).

> [!NOTE]  
> When a single bonus D20 is used, this provides results that are mathematically similar to the RQ:G system, without requiring table lookup or mental arithmetic. 

The option of using different numbers of bonus D20 provides an additional dimension by which different situations may be handled in game:

- if a contestant has *advantage*, roll 2 bonus die; use the higher one.

- if a contestant has *disadvantage*, roll 2 bonus die; use the lower value.

- if a contestant has *inspiration*, roll 2 bonus die; use the higher value on a success, and the lower value on a failure.

- if a contestant is *inactive*, they do not roll a bonus dice.


## How to read the D100 success dice

The success D100 is rolled in the same way as RQ:G. So if both dice are 0, the result is 100.

Ability values over 96 are treated as 96, 150 or more as 97, and so forth, up to a maximum of 99%. This modified value is the *effective ability*. 

Given that, a rolled value below or equal to the *effective ability* is counted as a *succesful roll*.

### how to read the D20 donus dice

Every 10 ability points over 100 grants a *critical bonus* of +1. This makes special and critical results more likely. 

> [!NOTE]  
> A skill is boosted by the Humakti rune magic _sword trance_ to a value of 251%. They have a 99% chance of making a successful roil, and a *critical bonus* of 15.
> RoS does not use the RQ:G mechanism of high skills reducing the opposing value, as no futher penalties will be reuqired to end the fight quickly.

- On a *successful roll*

  - add any *critical bonus* to the value rolled

  - a roll of 20 or more is a *critical*, of value 3
  
  - a roll of 17, 18 or 19 is a *special success*, of value 2.
  
  - any other value is a *normal success*, of value 1.
  
- On a *failed roll*

  - a roll of 1 is a *fumble*, of value -1
  
  - any other roll is a *normal failure*, of value 0.
  

### tie break mechanism

Normally, the contestant with the highest number of succcesses would win. Ties can be broken by looking at D100 value rolled.
The contestant with the highest value scores an extra success.
