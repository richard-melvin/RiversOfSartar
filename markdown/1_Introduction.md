# 1.0 Introduction

*Rivers of Sartar* is a unnofficial adaptation of the questworld engine to Chaosium's world of Glorantha. 

It changes certain aspects of the questworlds core mechanics to support the direct use of Chaosium-produced supplements such as the *Gloranthan Bestiary*, *Red Book of Magic* and *Cults of Runequest*.

It is a traditional roleplaying game in that there is a GM and players. The players play characters, each guided by the internal thoughts of their character as to what decisions they make, and the GM plays the world, including non-player characters (NPCs) and abstract threats.

It features an abstract, conflict-based, resolution method and scalable, customizable, character descriptions. Designed to emulate the way characters in fiction face and overcome challenges, it is suitable for a wide variety of genres and play styles. It is particularly suited to pulp genres (including their descendants comic books) and cinematic, larger-than-life, action.

It is a rules-light system that facilitates beginning play easily, and resolving conflicts in play quickly.

We refer to a rules-light but traditional roleplaying game as a storytelling game, after Greg Stafford's definition in *Prince Valiant*.

## 1.1 Why Rivers of Sartar?

Runequest:Glorantha provides detailed rules for effectively simulating the world of Glorantha. These help in understanding how that unfamiliar world works, but are often ignored in actual play by experienced GMs

Questworlds provides fast-handling storytelling rules that are capable of handling any genre, providing you already understand that genre.

Rivers of Sartar attenpts to blend these two approaches to provide the best of both worlds, in a way reminiscent of modern Chaosium BRP games such as Rivers of London.

It is always *fast-handling*, in that it requires almost no arithmetic, table lookup or repetitive dice rolling during play.

It starts from a baseline of storytelling, in a way that also allows elements of world-simulation and simple tactical gameplay to be added as desired.

It does not have the ambition of being a complete publishable game line, instead referencing sections and supplements from RQ:G and Questworlds as appropriate.

## 1.5 Participants

### 1.5.1 Players

You and your fellow players each create a Player Character (PC) to be the "avatar" or "persona" whose role you will play in the game. The PCs pursue various goals in an imaginary world, using their **abilities**, motivations, connections, and more to solve problems and overcome **story obstacles** that stand in their way.

When we say 'you' in this document we may mean either the player or their PC. Which of these we're addressing should be clear from the context or explicitly noted.

### 1.5.2 Game Master

Your Game Master (GM) is the interface between your imagination and the game-world in which the PCs have their adventures; describing the people, places, creatures, objects, and events therein. Your GM also plays the role of any Non-Player Characters (NPCs) with whom your PC interacts in the course of your adventures.

We generally refer to the GM as 'your GM' in this document's player-facing language. However, if you are the GM for a given game, this naturally refers to you.
