<h1 id="introduction">1.0 Introduction</h1>
<p><em>Rivers of Sartar</em> is a unnofficial adaptation of the
questworld engine to Chaosium’s world of Glorantha.</p>
<p>It changes certain aspects of the questworlds core mechanics to
support the direct use of Chaosium-produced supplements such as the
<em>Gloranthan Bestiary</em>, <em>Red Book of Magic</em> and <em>Cults
of Runequest</em>.</p>
<p>It is a traditional roleplaying game in that there is a GM and
players. The players play characters, each guided by the internal
thoughts of their character as to what decisions they make, and the GM
plays the world, including non-player characters (NPCs) and abstract
threats.</p>
<p>It features an abstract, conflict-based, resolution method and
scalable, customizable, character descriptions. Designed to emulate the
way characters in fiction face and overcome challenges, it is suitable
for a wide variety of genres and play styles. It is particularly suited
to pulp genres (including their descendants comic books) and cinematic,
larger-than-life, action.</p>
<p>It is a rules-light system that facilitates beginning play easily,
and resolving conflicts in play quickly.</p>
<p>We refer to a rules-light but traditional roleplaying game as a
storytelling game, after Greg Stafford’s definition in <em>Prince
Valiant</em>.</p>
<h2 id="why-rivers-of-sartar">1.1 Why Rivers of Sartar?</h2>
<p>Runequest:Glorantha provides detailed rules for effectively
simulating the world of Glorantha. These help in understanding how that
unfamiliar world works, but are often ignored in actual play by
experienced GMs</p>
<p>Questworlds provides fast-handling storytelling rules that are
capable of handling any genre, providing you already understand that
genre.</p>
<p>Rivers of Sartar attenpts to blend these two approaches to provide
the best of both worlds, in a way reminiscent of modern Chaosium BRP
games such as Rivers of London.</p>
<p>It is always <em>fast-handling</em>, in that it requires almost no
arithmetic, table lookup or repetitive dice rolling during play.</p>
<p>It starts from a baseline of storytelling, in a way that also allows
elements of world-simulation and simple tactical gameplay to be added as
desired.</p>

<p>The first version of these rules <em>Hero Wars</em> was published in
2000 (ISBN 978-1-929052-01-1)</p>
<p>The second version <em>HeroQuest</em> was published in 2003 (ISBN
978-1-929052-12-7). We refer to this as <em>HeroQuest</em> 1e to
disambiguate.</p>
<p>The third version <em>HeroQuest</em>: Core Rules was published in
2009 (ISBN 978-0-977785-32-2). We refer to this as <em>HeroQuest</em>
2e.</p>
<p><em>HeroQuest Glorantha</em> was published in 2015 (ISBN
978-1-943223-01-5). It is the version of the rules in <em>HeroQuest</em>
2e, presented for playing in Glorantha. We refer to this as
<em>HeroQuest</em> 2.1e.</p>
<p><em>QuestWorlds</em> was published as a System Reference Document
(SRD) (this document) in 2020. The version of the rules here is slightly
updated, mainly to clarify ambiguities, from the version presented in
<em>HeroQuest</em> 2e and <em>HeroQuest</em> 2.1e. This makes this
ruleset <em>HeroQuest</em> 2.2e, despite the name change. However, to
simplify we identify this version as <em>QuestWorlds</em> 1e.</p>
<p>An Appendix lists changes in this version. As the SRD is updated we
will continue to track version changes there.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-document-for">1.3 Who Is This Document For</h2>
<p>The primary audience for this document is game-masters who want to
run a questworlds-style game using the world supplments published for
Runequest:Glorantha## 1.4 Numbering</p>
<p>Sections within this document are numbered. This is for the benefit
of game designers and reviewers.</p>
<p>This does not imply that game designers need number the rules in
their own games.</p>
<p>Numbering however makes it easy to refer to rules in this document
when page numbers may vary by presentation format for the purposes of
error trapping or tracking changes. If you need to give us feedback
about this document, that will assist us.</p>
<h2 id="participants">1.5 Participants</h2>
<h3 id="players">1.5.1 Players</h3>
<p>You and your fellow players each create a Player Character (PC) to be
the “avatar” or “persona” whose role you will play in the game. The PCs
pursue various goals in an imaginary world, using their
<strong>abilities</strong>, motivations, connections, and more to solve
problems and overcome <strong>story obstacles</strong> that stand in
their way.</p>
<p>When we say ‘you’ in this document we may mean either the player or
their PC. Which of these we’re addressing should be clear from the
context or explicitly noted.</p>
<h3 id="game-master">1.5.2 Game Master</h3>
<p>Your Game Master (GM) is the interface between your imagination and
the game-world in which the PCs have their adventures; describing the
people, places, creatures, objects, and events therein. Your GM also
plays the role of any Non-Player Characters (NPCs) with whom your PC
interacts in the course of your adventures.</p>
<p>We generally refer to the GM as ‘your GM’ in this document’s
player-facing language. However, if you are the GM for a given game,
this naturally refers to you.</p>
<h1 id="mechanics">2.0 Mechanics</h1>
<p>In a <em>QuestWorlds</em> game, stories develop dynamically as you
and your GM work together to role-play the dramatic conflict between
your group’s PCs in pursuit of their goals and the challenges, or
threats that your GM presents to stand in your way. Stories advance by
two methods: conflict, where your PC is prevented from achieving their
goals because there is something that must be overcome, a <strong>story
obstacle</strong>, to gain a desired person, thing, or even status: the
<strong>prize</strong>; or there is something that must be understood, a
<strong>story question</strong>, to learn a secret, the past, or
comprehend: a different <strong>prize</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the course of play, your GM will present various <strong>story
obstacles</strong> and <strong>revelations</strong> as conflicts to the
PCs, resulting in either <strong>victory</strong> or
<strong>defeat</strong> for your character, which determines whether or
not you gain the <strong>prize</strong> you sought. These conflicts can
represent any sort of challenge you might face: fighting, a trial or
debate, survival in a harsh environment, out-wooing rival suitors, and
so on.</p>
<p>Rather than mechanically addressing the individual tasks that make up
these conflicts, <em>QuestWorlds</em> usually assesses your overall
<strong>victory</strong> or <strong>defeat</strong> in a single
<strong>contest</strong> where you and your GM make an opposed roll
pitting your characters <strong>ability</strong> vs the
<strong>resistance</strong> the <strong>story obstacle</strong> or
<strong>story question</strong> presents to you achieving the
<strong>prize</strong>.</p>
<p>Whenever the GM presents a <strong>story obstacle</strong> or
<strong>story question</strong> for you to overcome, you should
<strong>frame the contest</strong> by describing what you are trying to
accomplish, the <strong>prize</strong>, and which of your
<strong>abilities</strong> (see below) you want to use to achieve that
<strong>prize</strong>, and how.</p>
<p>Based on that <strong>framing</strong> and other factors, your GM
will assess what <strong>resistance</strong> the characters face.</p>
<p>You roll a twenty-sided die (D20) against your PC’s
<strong>ability</strong>, and your GM rolls a D20 against the
<strong>resistance</strong>. Your GM will assess your overall
<strong>victory</strong> or <strong>defeat</strong> in the contest based
on the <strong>success</strong> or <strong>failure</strong> of both
rolls, and narrates the results of your attempt to overcome the
<strong>story obstacle</strong> or answer the <strong>story
question</strong> and gain the <strong>prize</strong> accordingly. The
direction of the story changes, in either a big or small way, depending
on whether you gain the <strong>prize</strong> or not.</p>
<p>We encourage your GM to work with your suggestions when narrating the
<strong>victory</strong> or <strong>defeat</strong>, but the final
decision rests with them.</p>
<h2 id="abilities">2.1 Abilities</h2>
<p>Characters in <em>QuestWorlds</em> are defined by the
<strong>abilities</strong> they use to face the challenges that arise in
the course of their story. Rather than having a standard list of
attributes, skills, powers, etc. for all characters, anything that you
can apply overcome a <strong>story obstacle</strong> or answer a
<strong>story question</strong> could be one of your
<strong>abilities</strong>. While your GM may provide some example
<strong>abilities</strong> to choose from that connect your PC to a
particular story or game world (whether created by your GM or by the
designer of a particular game), you get to make up and describe most or
all of your <strong>abilities</strong>.</p>
<p>Some <strong>abilities</strong> might be broad descriptions of your
background or expertise, like “Dwarf of the Chalk Hills” or “Private
Detective” - implying a variety of related capabilities. Others might
represent specific capabilities or assets such as “Lore of the
Ancients,” “Captain of the Fencing Team,” or “The Jade Eye
Medallion.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, <strong>abilities</strong> are names for the interesting
things your character can do.</p>
<h3 id="keywords">2.1.1 Keywords</h3>
<p>A <strong>keyword</strong> is a broad <strong>ability</strong> that
often represents an occupation, a heritage, a belief system or
participation in a community. The simplest way to use a
<strong>keyword</strong> is as an <strong>ability</strong> that
represents the competencies of an occupation, knowledge and attitudes
passed down via a heritage, values of a belief system, or relationships
from a community. In the kinds of fiction that <em>QuestWorlds</em>
emulates it is usually enough to know that someone has a particular
occupation or heritage to know what they can do.</p>
<p>A <strong>keyword</strong> reduces the number of
<strong>abilities</strong> your PC needs to track, and is a
simplification to help you easily create archetypical characters for a
genre without excessive bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Your GM’s genre pack should have a text description, which hints at
the credible uses of a <strong>keyword</strong>.</p>
<p>Any broad concept you come up with for an <strong>ability</strong>,
may be better presented as a <strong>keyword</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="breakouts">2.1.1.1 Breakouts</h4>
<p>A <strong>breakout</strong> allows you to track a competency within
the <strong>keyword</strong> individually, as an
<strong>ability</strong>.</p>
<p>If your character is renowned for a skill that credibly falls under
one of your <strong>keywords</strong>, you create a <strong>breakout
ability</strong> under the <strong>keyword</strong> at a
<strong>bonus</strong> from the <strong>rating</strong> of the
<strong>keyword</strong>. You write these specialized <strong>breakout
abilities</strong> under the <strong>keyword</strong>, along with how
much they’ve improved from the <strong>keyword</strong>:</p>
<p>Detective 15</p>
<ul>
<li>Deduction +5</li>
<li>Hard Drinking +5</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, whilst the <strong>rating</strong> for most
<strong>contests</strong> in which Detective was an appropriate
<strong>tactic</strong> would be 15, for contests involving Deduction it
would be 20.</p>
<p>A <strong>breakout</strong> begins at +5 when purchased during
character creation or improvement. A <strong>distinguishing
characteristic</strong> (see §3.0) under a <strong>keyword</strong>
begins at +10.</p>
<p>The list of <strong>breakout abilities</strong> in a
<strong>keyword</strong> is open-ended, but your GM’s genre pack
description of the keyword will provide inspiration, and might include a
list of suggested <strong>abilities</strong> for unfamiliar settings,
where it is less clear what a <strong>keyword</strong> encompasses.</p>
<p>Even if there is a suggested list, the potential uses of the
<strong>keyword</strong> are always open-ended, provided they are
credible. As the genre pack description tends to be assumed in the
<strong>keyword</strong>, which is already treated as an
<strong>ability</strong>, it can be more interesting to have them
<em>differentiate</em> your PC from the archetype.</p>
<h3 id="flaws">2.1.2 Flaws</h3>
<p>Your character may have one or more <strong>flaws</strong>. Unlike an
<strong>ability</strong>, you do not use a <strong>flaw</strong> to
accomplish something; instead the GM uses your <strong>flaw</strong> to
hinder you from accomplishing something, or invokes your
<strong>flaw</strong> to force you to act a certain way.
<strong>Flaws</strong> are used to enrich your character and provide
story obstacles to be overcome.</p>
<p><strong>Flaws</strong> may be psychological challenges such as
“Addict”, fears or compulsive behaviors such as “Afraid of Snakes” or
“Needs Lucky Rabbit’s Foot”, physical challenges such as “One-Eyed,”
“Wheelchair-Bound” or “Asthmatic.” A <strong>flaw</strong> might also be
a philosophy such as “Code Against Killing,” “Pacifist,” or “Radical
Candor” that limit your freedom of action. A <strong>flaw</strong> might
be a relationship that creates obligations such as a “Frail Aunt,”
“Single Dad,” or “Blackmailed”.</p>
<p>Many <strong>flaws</strong> describe attributes that can be viewed
positively. By making it a <strong>flaw</strong> and not an
<strong>ability</strong> you are inviting your GM to use it to make your
life more difficult, not easier.</p>
<p>You should not use your <strong>flaw</strong> to accomplish
something; if you feel that is likely, use an <strong>ability</strong>
and flag to your GM when you want them to treat it as a
<strong>flaw</strong> at an appropriate moment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, in <em>QuestWorlds</em> a <strong>flaw</strong> is simply
something that you invite the GM to use to hinder or prevent your
character doing something. In return for the GM exercising the
<strong>flaw</strong> you gain <strong>experience points</strong> (see
§8.1).</p>
<p>In play your PC may work to overcome a <strong>flaw</strong> and you
may reach the point that you agree with your GM that story events mean
that it is no longer relevant. You can then drop that
<strong>flaw</strong> from your character sheet when you receive an
advance (see §8.2).</p>
<p>You can add a new <strong>flaw</strong> if play suggests one might
emerge, with discussion with the GM, when you receive an
<strong>advance</strong> (see §8.2).</p>
<h3 id="ratings-and-masteries">2.1.3 Ratings and Masteries</h3>
<p><em>QuestWorlds</em> <strong>abilities</strong> are scored on a
<strong>rating</strong> of 1–20, representing the <strong>target number
(TN)</strong> you need to roll or less to succeed in a
<strong>contest</strong> (see §2.3 for more details).</p>
<p>Once your <strong>ability</strong> passes 20, you would always be
able to roll under it on a D20. So to allow abilities to scale over 20
we use <strong>tiers</strong> of capability we refer to as a
<strong>masteries</strong>.</p>
<p>We denote a <strong>rating</strong> with a <strong>mastery</strong>
as <strong>TN</strong> + M, for example 7M represents a
<strong>TN</strong> of 7 and one <strong>mastery</strong>. We represent
abilities above 20M as <strong>TN</strong> + M2, for example 4M2
represents a <strong>TN</strong> of 4 and two
<strong>masteries</strong>.</p>
<p>The progression of <strong>ability</strong> <strong>ratings</strong>
is: 1-20, 1M-20M, 1M2-20M2, 1M3-20M3 and so on.</p>
<p>Specific <em>QuestWorlds</em> games or genre packs may use other
symbols relevant to their setting or genre to denote
<strong>mastery</strong> instead of M. If so, this should be clearly
noted by their designers.</p>
<p>For how <strong>masteries</strong> work in play, see §2.3.6.</p>
<h3 id="no-relevant-ability">2.1.4 No Relevant
<strong>Ability</strong></h3>
<p>You may sometimes be faced with a <strong>story obstacle</strong> or
<strong>story question</strong> for which you have no relevant
<strong>ability</strong> whatsoever. In such cases, you may still enter
into conflict with the <strong>story obstacle</strong> using a
<strong>stretch</strong> or a <strong>rating</strong> of 5 for your
<strong>contest</strong> roll.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-ratings">2.1.5 Understanding Ratings</h3>
<p><em>QuestWorlds</em> treats <strong>ratings</strong> as a measure of
how effective you are at solving problems with the
<strong>ability</strong>, and does not limit what you can do with that
<strong>ability</strong>, provided your actions are credible in
genre.</p>
