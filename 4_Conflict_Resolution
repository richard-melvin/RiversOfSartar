## Freeform Gameplay


In freeform play, the type and sequence of rolls to be made should be based on the logic of the situation, the underlying reason why it is being rolled for, and the need to involve all participatinmg players. For example, for a challenge that takes place 
at a time known in advance, there is likely time for as many secondary actions as can be thought of. A trial with three witnesses to be presented will be three opposed roll, before a decisive concluding argument. 
On the other hand, if there is no time pressure or risk, a task might reasonably  be attempted indefinitely 
until the desired result is achieved. In such cases, it is better to treat the task as automatically successful if there is a non-zero chance of success.

A contest has two or more opposing *sides*, each of which has one or more *contestants*. A contestant is typically an individual, but may be a closely cooperating group, or environmental factor. 
PCs will commonly be contestants on the same *side*. But if they are not, then the same rules work. 

Only those contestants participating in a given roll are the *involved contestants*. This will commonly not be all the contestant in a contest, and may be only two. 
For example an archer and a target, or a lawspeaker and a witness. for either, while the results of that roll will contirbute to the success of the battle or trial, only those invloved get to roll

In a tactical challenge, additional rules apply to who gets to make what type of roll, and when; see [xxx] for details.

### Types of Roll

A *decisive roll* represents a test to definitively resolve a conflict, determining a winner, using a tie-break mechanism if required. 
The result indicates what happens, allowing consequences to be applied and the story to move on to whatever happens next.

An *opposed roll* represents a test to see if specific attempt as an individual challenge or task is successful. It is normally part of a larger dequence of tasks, called a *contest*, which will evetually terminate by a *decisive roll*. 
The consequences of success and failure apply only to the state of that *contest*; an opposed roll that is not part of a contest has no mechanical effect. 

A *secondary roll* represents an attempt to inspire, prepare for, assist in, or supervise the performance of a task or challenge.

Secondary rolls broadly correspond to the RQ:G and QW mechanism of *augments*. They are less consequential than an opposed roll, but may be possible in 
circumstances, or at a timing, where a full opposed roll is not. 

Note that as a contest evolves over a sequence of rolls, it is not necessary to commit to any set of possible consequences until the time a decisive roll is called for. 
So a party may scout a group of unkown raiders in order to evaluate their strength, before comitting to either a skirmish, a full combat, or running away. 


### opposed roll
All involved contestants roll D100 and zero or more D20, as described in the previous section. The number of successes each contestant has scored is recorded.


### decisive roll


For a decisive roll, the number of success points scored by each involved contestant are determined in the same way as for an opposed roll.

Then the totals for each contestant on each side are added up and compared. 
If the final result is an equal number of successes, a tie break rule is applied to all contestants from tied sides to give one side an extra success. 

This involves adding the value rolled and any *tiebreak bonus* the tied contestants have.
The contestant with the highest value scores an extra success for their side. 

In the rare case that this doesn't produce a winner, the outcome is a *dead heat* and the contest either 
continues or ends without resolution.

### example contests

1. hard days riding

1. background knowledge

1. spotting a clue

1. fighting off raiders

1. humakti duel

## who wins

By default, a contest ends immediately after a *decisive roll*. 
The contestant with the most successes wins, if there is one. 


Howeer, any loser of a contest may take *consequences*
