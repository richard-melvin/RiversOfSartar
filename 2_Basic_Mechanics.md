# 2.0 Mechanics

In a *Rivers of Sartar* game, stories develop dynamically as you and your GM work together to role-play the dramatic conflict between your group's PCs in pursuit of their 
goals and the challenges,or threats that your GM presents to stand in your way. 

## when to roll?


Some reasons for using randomness in game mechanics include:

1. characterisation: a party must travel for a day on horseback over open terrain. Perhaps characters who fail a ride test simply have an uncomfortable day. They get a 
  chance to express their discomfort, and perhaps wish they were somewhere else.

1. character selection:  a clue could be discovered by any of several characters. It is likely, but not guaranteed, that the one who does so is the one who has the highest rating in a relevant ability. 
   Either case provides an opportunity for characterisation, and possibly, if the players goals are not completely aligned, further plot development.

1. plot branching: a clue might be missed, perhaps placing the party in a dangerous situation they would have preferred to avoid, or requiring them to take a different approach.

1. attrition of resources: performing badly in an encounter might deplete limitied supplies of food or healing magic.

1. risk of death: having the risk of death be present in some, but not all, situations creates a useful distinction between danger and safety.

1. tactical challenge: a game that involves interesting mechanical decisions can be fun in its own right.

If none of these reasons apply, it is likely the situation can be resolved without explicit mechanics or randomness. The PCs simply describe what they do, and the GM narrates what happens next, 
somehwat in the 'Yes, and' style of improvisational comedy. 

Alternatively, multiple of these purposes can be combined in a single situation, such as when it is possible any of several characters might discover a clue, but it is also possible noone will.

Support for the first 5 reasons is provided by section 2, *Freeform Gameplay*.. The last is covered by section 3, *Tactical Gameplay*.


## what to roll?

Rivers of Sartar is based on a set of dice roll mechanics that can be applied in a uniform way to any numeric input on a percatile scale. These include:

1. skills

1. runes

1. passions

1. characteristics

1. reputation

1. relationships

1. circumstantial advantages

In most, these valeus are fixed over the scope of a single game session, and should be recorded on a character sheet. Characters for Rivers of Sartar can be created 
by any of the methods supported by RQ:G and QuestWorlds.

For RQ:G characters, all of these values are on a scale compatible with the dice rolling mechanism, except characteristics, which should be multipled by 5. 
For questworlds characters, all values should be multipled by 5.



## what to roll against

The opposition to a roll is on the same scale as PC skills. It can be determined in any of a number of ways:.

1. known value: one established previously, or printed in a published scenario

1. estimated difficulty: one estimated based on similar examples

1. narratively appropriate value: one necessary to support the reasons for making this roll in the first place.

1. circumstantial disadvantages: darkness, injury and so on

1. zero: having zero as a possible opposition simplfies the rules by dropping the need for unnposed rolls


The value chosen is the *opposition value*: a number at least 0, and typically under a hundred. 
An opposition vaue of 200 or more is unlikely to be directly overcome by a normal group of PCs.

Note that the case the opposition value is chosen for narrative raasons, the description of what is happenning should be adjusted correspondingly. 
For example, if the GM expects  the players to probably be captured, but not rule out the possibility of escape, then a high but not unbeatable 
opposiiton should be chosen. This should then be _described_ as an approprate number of well armed and competent opponents.

in other words, ideally the in-world description of the opposition and their mechanical rating should generally match, by whatever method the two are selected. 
A lowly farmer who fights with godlike skill will be doing so because they are literally inspired by the gods, rather than because the plot demands it. 
This can still be so, even if it is the case that the plot required that they be so inspired.

## variable levels of success

In normal circumstances, contestants will also roll a single d20 to determine the success level (i.e. check for criticals, specials success and fumbles). 
Characters that have an active runic inspiration or passion may roll 2 or more.

A contestant that represents purely environment factors, or disintertested characters not actively opposing the PCs (e.g. unalert guards) does not roll a success level d20.

In the case where multiple dice are used, then on a success the best (highest value) dice is used. On a failure, the lowest value D20 is used. 
This means that acting passionately increase both the chance of great success and great failure.

## how to roll

All rolls are opposed rolls, between two or more *contestants*. Each contestant simultaneously rolls a single D100 and zero or more D20s.
When a single D20 is used, this provides results that are mathematically similar to the RQ:G system, without requiring table lookup or mental arithmetic. 
The option of using different numbers of D20 provides an addiional dimension by which different situaitons may be handled in game.


### how to read the D100

A D100 is rolled in the same way as RQ:G. So if both dice are 0, the result is 100.

Values over 96 are treated as 96, over 197 as 97, and so forth. This modified value is the *effective skill*. Any excess skill is referred to as the *tiebreak bonus*, and is used in *decisive rolls* (see below)

> [!NOTE]  
> A skill is boosted by the Humakti rune magic _sword trance_ to a value of 251%. It has a 97% chance of making a successful roil, and a *tiebreak bonus* of 154.

Given that, a rolled value below or equal to the *effective skill* is counted as a *succesful roll*.

### how to read the D20s

- On a *successful roll*

  - any roll of 20 is a *critical*, of value 3
  
  - any roll of 17, 18 or 19 is a *special success*, of value 2.
  
  - any other value is a *normal success*, of value 1.
  
  - if multiple dice are rolled, the highest value is used.

- On a *failed roll*

  - any roll of 1 is a *fumble*, of value -1
  
  - any other roll is a *normal failure*, of value 0.
  
  - if multiple dice are rolled, the lowest value is used.
  

### tie break mechanism

Normally, the contestant with the highest number of succcesses would win. Ties can be broken by adding the value rolled to any *tiebreak bonus* the tied contestants have.
The contestant with the highest value scores an extra success. 


> [!NOTE]  
> Thus the Humakti with a *tiebreak bonus* of 154 has, all things equal, a very small chance (<10%) of losing to anyone with a merly human-level of skill (< 150).
