# 4.0 Ongoing Contests

In an ongoing contest, a sequence of rolls are used to *resolve* a single contest. As with freeform play, success or failure simply changes the situation which must be dealt with.
Compared to freeform gameplay, within that contest, additional rules and guidelines apply, and so the need for GM fiat is somewhat lessened. 

A contest normally ends with a *decisive roll*,  
A PC may *reject* the result of a decisive roll, normally because they lost. If they do, the contest continues, but they must immediately apply mechanical *consequences* based on how badly they would have lost. 

An ongoing contest in which the first roll is decisive is effectively the same as an an opposed roll in freeform play. So the type of contest does not need to be selected in advance, 
it can emerge organically based on what the players actually decide to do. Do they hang back to evaluate the situation, or charge in?

### Contest Resolution


Within a contest, the type and sequence of rolls to be made should be based on the logic of the situation, the underlying reason why it is being rolled for, and the need to involve all participatinmg players. For example, for a challenge that takes place 
at a time known in advance, there is likely time for as many status actions as can be thought of. A trial with three witnesses to be presented will be three opposed rolls, before a decisive concluding argument. 
On the other hand, if there is no time pressure or risk, a task might reasonably  be attempted indefinitely 
until the desired result is achieved. In such cases, it is better to treat the task as automatically successful if there is a non-zero chance of success.

A contest has two or more opposing *sides*, each of which has one or more *contestants*. A contestant is typically an individual, but may be a closely cooperating group, or environmental factor. 
PCs will commonly be contestants on the same *side*. But if they are not, then the same rules work. 

Only those contestants participating in a given roll are the *involved contestants*. This will commonly not be all the contestant in a contest, and may be only two. 
For example an archer and a target, or a lawspeaker and a witness. For either, while the results of that roll will contribute to the success of the battle or trial, only those invloved get to roll

In a tactical challenge, additional rules apply to who gets to make what type of roll, and when; see the next section for details.

### Types of Roll

A *decisive roll* represents a test to definitively resolve a contest, determining a winner, using a tie-break mechanism if required. 
The result indicates what happens, allowing consequences to be applied and the story to move on to whatever happens next.

An *task roll* represents a test to see if specific attempt as an individual challenge or task is successful. It is normally part of a larger dequence of tasks, called a *contest*, which will evetually terminate by a *decisive roll*. 
The consequences of success and failure apply only to the state of that *contest*; an opposed roll that is not part of a contest has no mechanical effect. 

A *status roll* represents an attempt to inspire, prepare for, assist in, or supervise the performance of a task or challenge.

Note that as a contest evolves over a sequence of rolls, it is not necessary to commit to any set of possible consequences until the time a decisive roll is called for. 
So a party may scout a group of unknown raiders in order to evaluate their strength, before comitting to either a skirmish, a full combat, or running away. 


### Status Roll

A status roll represents an attempt to inspire, prepare for, assist in, or supervise the performance of a task or challenge. 
If successful, a status effect is applied to, or removed from one contestant for each level of success.

Status rolls broadly correspond to the RQ:G and QW mechanism of *augments*. They are less consequential than an opposed roll, but may be possible in 
circumstances, or at a timing, where a full opposed roll is not. 

#### Task roll
This is an opposed roll with no tiebreak.
All involved contestants roll a D100 and zero or more D20, with the number depending on any status effects they have active.
The number of successes each contestant has scored is recorded.


#### Decisive roll
This is an opposed roll with tiebreak rule applied. All involved contestants roll a D100 and zero or more D20, as for a task roll.

Then the totals for each contestant on each side are added up and compared. 
If the final result is an equal number of successes, a tie break rule is applied to all contestants from tied sides to give one side an extra success. 

This means the contestant with the highest value scores an extra success for their side. 

In the rare case that this doesn't produce a winner, the outcome is a *dead heat*. The contest either 
continues or ends without resolution.



## who gets to roll





### example onoing contests

1. cross country horseback chase

1. research project to find details of a heroquest

1. winning over a hostile clan chieftan

1. fighting off raiders

1. humakti duel

## who wins

By default, a contest ends immediately after a *decisive roll*. 
The side with the most successes wins, if there is one. 


However, the losers of a contest may take as many *consequences* as required to match the successes scored by the winning side.
